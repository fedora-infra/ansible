  ns05 is a master dns server.
  It serves about every domain under fedoraproject, fedo*, as well as others, both forward and reverse.

  * This host relies on:
  - The virthost it's hosted on (internetx02.fedoraproject.org)
  - batcave for dns git and keys
  - connectivity to maxmind to create geoIP dns acl

  * Things that rely on this host:
  - The Internet/Community to resolve everything related to fedora and reverse-IP for allocated subnets
  - If this host is down, dns queries will slow down by the portion of this host to the total name servers responsible for the same domain set.
  - secodary/slave dns servers
