csi_relationship: |

    ns02 is a master dns server.
    It serves about every domain under fedoraproject, fedo*, as well as others, both forward and reverse.

    * This host relies on:
    - The virthost it's hosted on (ibiblio05.fedoraproject.org)
    - batcave for dns git and keys
    - connectivity to maxmind to create geoIP dns acl

    * Things that rely on this host:
    - The Internet/Community to resolve everything related to fedora and reverse-IP for allocated subnets
    - If this host is down, dns queries will slow down by the portion of this host to the total name servers responsible for the same domain set.
    - secodary/slave dns servers
