  - Provides ssh access to all iad2/vpn connected servers.
  - Bastion is the hub for all infrastructure's VPN connections.
  - All incoming SMTP from iad2 and VPN, as well as outgoing SMTP,
    pass or are filtered here.
  - Bastion does not accept any mail outside phx2/vpn.

# drop incoming traffic from less trusted vpn hosts
