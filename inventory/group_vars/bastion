  SSH proxy to access infrastructure not exposed to the web

  * Provides ssh access to all rdu3/vpn connected servers.
  * Bastion is the hub for all infrastructure's VPN connections.
  * All incoming SMTP from rdu3 and VPN, as well as outgoing SMTP, pass or are filtered here.
  * Bastion does not accept any mail outside phx2/vpn.
