  Run the Bodhi masher.

  Check the bodhi masher docs/code for more detail on what it does:
    https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/blob/develop/bodhi/consumers/masher.py

  * This host relies on:
    * db01 for its database, which is shares with the bodhi2 frontend nodes.
    * An NFS mount of koji data in /mnt/koji/
    * The fedora messaging for triggering mashes.
    * XMLRPC calls to koji for tagging and untagging updates.
    * bugzilla for posting comments about status changes
    * the wiki for getting information about QA "Test Cases"
    * taksotron (resultsdb) for getting status-check results (gating updates).

  * No other systems rely directly on this host.  Everything depends on it
    indirectly for the creation of new updates repos (which get synced out to
    the master mirror for distribution.
