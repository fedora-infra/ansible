General VM requirements for builder VMs
---------------------------------------

- 2xvCPU
- 16GB RAM
- 16G for built results
-  4G for root partition
- SWAP+RAM
  - 32GB for /var/lib/mock tmpfs
  - 140GB tmpfs for mock root(s)


AMD hypervisors
===============

vmhost-x86-copr0[1-4].rdu-cc.fedoraproject.org

- 256G RAM
- 64 threads (2x16 cores)
- 2.6T+ storage
- 300 G SWAP

This brings us 32+ (few devel) overcommitted builders on each builder:

 - 32*16G = up to 512 GRAM (256 RAM + 300 G SWAP)
 - 4G+16G = 20G*32 = up to 640G for root+results
 - 172G*32 = up to 5.5T SWAP for tmpfs (huge overcommit, though only limitted
   amount of build tasks require that much tmpfs)

Manually created swap:

  1. lvcreate -L 300G vg_guests -n swap
  2. mkswap -L swap /dev/mapper/vg_guests-swap

Manually created space for volumes/images:

  1. lvcreate -n images -l 100%FREE vg_guests
  2. mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg_guests-images -L vmvolumes

Manually created br0 interface.

  Not done by me, TODO: add steps.
