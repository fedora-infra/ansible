      Dear Administrator,

      This is a reminder that the Communishift project {{ item.value.name }} will be deleted during the Fedora post
      release process. At the same time the oldest fedora is retired (1 month after a new fedora release).
      Please ensure you have a backup of any important configuration or data from your project. Consult Openshift docs.

      If you need to request an exemption, please file a ticket here: https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issues
      Reference the project name and please provide a reason for the extention, and how long you wish the extention to be
      in place for.
