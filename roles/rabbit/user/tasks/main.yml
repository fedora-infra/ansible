# Ensure a user exists in RabbitMQ with permissions to only publish.
# This is intended to be something most applications can use, but if you need
# more flexibility, just use the rabbitmq_user module directly.
#
# Required parameters:
#
#   - user_name (str): the username to create in RabbitMQ, which should match the
#                      CN of the certificate.
#
# Optional parameters:
#
#   - user_sent_topics (str): A regular expression that must match the topic when a
#                             message is published by this user.

# See https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html#permissions for details on
# the RabbitMQ permissions configuration.
