This directory contains variables (one per file) that are loaded into
various playbooks. The first set of these is to allow templates to
handle the various stages of EPEL development so we don't have to
remember all the places that need changing.

There's 3 states for EPEL releases:

1:

EPEL N (stable)
EPEL N-1 (stable)

2: We enable branch requests for a new release:

EPEL N+1 (bootstrap)
EPEL N (stable)
EPEL N-1 (stable)

3. That release is launched:

EPEL N (stable)
EPEL N-1 (stable)
EPEL N-2 (stable)

These are controlled by some variables:

00-EPELCycleNumber.yaml - The current stable release
EPELBootstrapNumber.yaml - The number of the bootstrap release
