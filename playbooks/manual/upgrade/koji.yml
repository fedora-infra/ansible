# How to run this playbook:
#
# $ sudo -i ansible-playbook /srv/web/infra/ansible/playbooks/manual/upgrade/koji.yml \
#         -l \*.stg.\* \
#         -e db_upgrade_file=/usr/share/doc/koji-1.13.0/docs/schema-upgrade-1.12-1.13.sql
#
# The above command will run the playbook and (-l) limit the run to only staging
# nodes.  The extra var db_upgrade_file is passed in which tells the playbook to
# run that script on the database after bringing down the koji hubs.
#
# Steps (from nirik in #fedora-releng)
#   1) make outage ticket
#   2) get reviewed
#   3) send to devel-announce
#   4) take down koji01/02 httpds
#   5) upgrade database
#   6) update hubs
#   7) update all builders
#   8) restart
#
# TODO:
# - stop and restart kojira on koji02
# - kill any koji-gc processes
# - nagios outage stuff didn't seem to work as well as we would want last time.
